# Hi there, I'm Beatriz Franco 

I'm a 19-year-old student studying Statistics at the Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), Brazil, currently in the 3rd semester of the course.  
I'm a dedicated and curious learner, always seeking to grow in the field of technology and expand my knowledge.  
Outside of the world of programming, I love watching movies and playing sports.
